# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Code Book

This is the code book for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

## Background

The reference zip file was downloaded and uncompressed. The documentation files were read (several times) to understand data. The data files were examined.

The data has training and test parts that are to be combined.

Each part has three component files: a 561-values/row training/test data file, an activity label file, and a subject file. Specifically,

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'test/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

## Procedure

The training and test data was associated with its corresponding subject and activity.

The mean and standard deviation fields to be extracted were identified from the features.txt file.
